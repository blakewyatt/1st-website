            Let's be honest, my greatest super powers are wit and charm.<br/> 
            But if you want a more literal interpretation of my superhuman abilities,<br/> 
            I have a healing factor, which allows me to recover from grave injuries by regenerating<br/>
            entire body parts. I'm also an expert marksman and hand-to-hand combatant.<br/>
            It's true-I'm basically a ninja. And I speak a bunch of languages,<br/>
            like Japanese, German, and Spanish, but most of the time I pretend I don't.<br/>
            Oh! And I have the ability to harness continuity errors and break the fourth wall.<br/>
            Kinda like right now.<br/>
        </p>

        <p id = "badGuysHeader">Da Baddies:</p>
        <p id = "badGuys">
            First, there's my work associates, like Hammerhead, the Mercs for Money,<br/>
            Wilson Fisk, Bullseye, Tolliver, Taskmaster, and Weasel.<br/>
            Then there's the people who have always hated me: T-Ray, the Boss, Madcap,<br/>
            Dr. Emrys Killebrew, Wizard, Typhoid, Sabretooth, and Thanos.<br/>
            Then there's the jilted ex-lovers: Death, Copycat, Anastasia, and Shiklah.<br/>
        </p>

        <p id = "goodGuysHeader">My Friends:</p>
        <p id = "goodGuys">
            And then we have the good guys who, generally, wouldn't mind if<br/>
            Kraven the Hunter turned my skin into a cummerbund. This list includes<br/>
            the X-Men, the Avengers, X-Force, S.H.I.E.L.D., the Secret Defenders,<br/>
            the Great Lakes Avengers, Cable, Siryn, Spider-Man, and of course my<br/>
            closest friend, Blind Al. (But spidey is actually my bestie. Just don't tell Al.)<br/>
